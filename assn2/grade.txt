Notes: 

[1] Certainly, the anisotropic shading is important, but the
individual threads are also very visible and an important part of the
appearance. The threads coming off of the ball are pretty significant
too. 

[2] You got the anisotropic shading, but not the threads, or other
variations in surface color.

[3] If you'd managed your own implementation of an anisotropic shading
model, I might have been willing to accept that alone. Since you used
the one provided by RenderMonkey, I would expect you to have gone
considerably further modeling other aspects of the appearance.

Other notes: You don't need texture to implement these models
anymore. These references are from 10 years ago, and graphics hardware
has advanced quite a bit since then. They used textures and other
tricks because GPU shaders didn't exist. Now it should be just a
couple of lines of code. Note that you do need at least one surface
tangent vector as well as the surface normal. For an object as simple
as a sphere, you can just project the sphere axis onto the tangent
plane to get a good consistent tangent vector aligned with the thread
direction.

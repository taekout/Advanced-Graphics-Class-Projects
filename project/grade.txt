Notes:

[1] You have a tendency to write long single-paragraph sections. It
would help to organize them if you broke those up into a few
coherent paragraphs. This is especially evident in the Related Work
section.

Your writing has some issues both structurally and in English
language. I don't believe it's all the language though -- learning to
write well takes time, but is worth it (even when I was at SGI, there
were things I had to write for work). You should take advantage of the
writing center for course papers like this. They won't do something
like a Thesis, so plan to take a little more time on that, with
plenty of revisions read by other readers. I've been doing this for a
while, and I still do at least half a dozen full revisions on any
paper I submit.
